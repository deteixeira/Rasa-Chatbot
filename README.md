# Rasa-Chatbot

To run this project, you need to download:
- Rasa version 3.1.0 (https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/installation/installing-rasa-open-source)
- Python 3.9.7

(be aware that it is important to follow the steps to activate your conda environment. You can follow this tutorial if you need any help: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment)

Additionally, you also need to download this project: https://rasahq.github.io/rasa-nlu-examples/ (present in this repository: https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-nlu-examples). This step is important because this project contains the GensimFeaturizer, which implements the word2vec model. Without this project, rasa cannot read your word2vec model.

When the project is already in your computer, don't forget to do the following change:
- in "config.yml" file, you need to indicate where you saved your word2vec model (line 20, variable cache_dir)

If you don't have your own word2vec model, you can use mine that is present in the "w2c" folder. If you want to use a model with more training data, you can also download the word2vec model from Google: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?resourcekey=0-wjGZdNAUop6WykTtMip30g . This model is explained in https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/

Before running the project, you need to train it. To do that, open a terminal and write the following command: rasa train


To run this project, you need to open 2 terminals.
In the first terminal, you will run the actions that are present in file "actions.py". Write the following command to run the actions:
- rasa run actions

In the other terminal, you need to start the rasa server. To do that, run the following command:
- rasa run -m models --enable-api --cors "\*"
This command not only starts the rasa server, but also starts the web server API (using --enable-api) and allows an URL to make requests to the server (using --cors "\*")

After, open your project in the right directory. My directory is the following:
- file:///C:/Users/debor/OneDrive/Documentos/faculdade/5%C2%BA%20ano/tese/c%C3%B3digo/RASA/bot2/index.html"

but make sure you indicate the right directory where you saved the index.html file in your computer.

Hope you enjoy :)
